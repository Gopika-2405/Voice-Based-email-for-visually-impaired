Voice-Based Email System for Visually Impaired Individuals: Compose, Schedule, and Send Emails

Many people around us live with disabilities, facing daily obstacles. Efforts are being made to improve their quality of life by developing new technologies or enhancing existing ones, especially in web and mobile applications. These applications should be made accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.

The goal of this project stems from this need. In this project, we propose to create a voice-based email system specifically for visually impaired users. This system will be a web-based application that detects and processes users' voices. Below are the functions the application will provide for composing, scheduling, and sending emails:

- **Compose Email:** The application will allow users to dictate their emails. It will record the userâ€™s voice and convert it into text, which will then be displayed or read aloud for confirmation.
- **Schedule Email:** The application will include a scheduling feature where users can set a specific date and time for the email to be sent. This will involve recognizing commands like "send this tomorrow at 9 AM."
- **Send Email:** The application will have a voice-triggered command for sending the email after it is composed. Users will confirm the recipient and content before sending the email, with the option to review the email content via voice feedback.
- **Menu:** The application will feature a voice-controlled menu listing all actions, allowing users to navigate and select tasks like composing, scheduling, or sending an email.
- **Interface:** A simple and accessible interface will be provided for users to compose, schedule, and send emails.

To achieve these functionalities, the application will incorporate speech-to-text conversion for composing emails, text-to-speech feedback for confirmation and scheduling, and a keyword recognition process for triggering email commands. 

This will enable visually impaired individuals to seamlessly compose, schedule, and send emails without the need for visual interaction.
